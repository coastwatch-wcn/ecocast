### Mission and Vision
EcoCast is a fisheries sustainability tool that helps fishers and managers evaluate how to allocate fishing effort to maintain target fish catch while minimizing bycatch of protected or threatened species.

The mission of our project is to bring best-available science and analyses to support the ecological sustainability and economic viability for U.S. fisheries. With decades of experience in fisheries bycatch, fisheries mapping, oceanographic and species distribution analyses, our research team is working to support the development of innovative management approaches that meet ecological and economic management objectives and mandates.

### EcoCast Team
EcoCast is a consortium of scientists, managers, and members of the fishing industry, including:  

- San Diego State University  
- UC Santa Cruz  
- University of Maryland  
- Old Dominion University  
- Stanford University  
- NOAA Environmental Resource Division  

They work directly with resource managers, fishing industry, and other stakeholders.

## Dynamic Ocean Management

Dynamic ocean management is a new management approach that uses real-time and near real-time data to support management responses that can change in space and time, at scales relevant for animal movement and human use. Dynamic ocean management can use diverse analytical approaches (simple to complex), supports climate-resilient fisheries, and is already implemented in many oceans around the world.


### How does it differ from traditional ocean management?

<span style="font-weight:bold" class="noaa-blue">Traditional Ocean Management</span>

- Boundaries are fixed in space and time.
- Static schemes must be large enough to capture broad-scale ocean processes.
- Can have high opportunity costs for fishers.
- Rendered ineffective during anomalous events (e.g. species seasonal migrations or shifts of fishing fleets).

<span style="font-weight:bold" class="noaa-blue">Dynamic Ocean Management</span>

- Boundaries and recommendations can change in near real time.
- Align management actions with the variability of ecosystems.
- Incorporates diverse data sources:
  - Satellite data
  - Ocean monitoring arrays
  - Bio-geochemical models
  - Crowd-sourced reports from ocean users
- Provides managers with recommendations that reflect current marine conditions.

### Why it matters

Dynamic ocean management sits at the interface of science and management. It captures the best-available science and directs it to meet the needs of resource managers and the fishing industry. 

<span style="font-weight:bold" class="noaa-blue">What’s exciting about this research:</span>

- Puts science and data analytics to work in real time, and
- Fundamentally changes how oceans are managed.
