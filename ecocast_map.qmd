## EcoCast Map Product FAQs

<details class="ecocast-faq">
<summary><strong>What is the EcoCast Map product?</strong></summary>

The EcoCast Map product is a novel fishery sustainability tool that helps fishers and managers better evaluate how to allocate fishing effort to optimize the catch of target species (e.g. swordfish) while minimizing the accidental bycatch of blue sharks and protected species (leatherback sea turtles, California sea lions).

<details class="ecocast-faq">
<summary><strong>How do I use the EcoCast Map product?</strong></summary>

<span style="color:blue;">Better for fishing</span> is indicated by increasingly blue colors, showing where the likelihood of target catch is good and the likelihood of bycatch in lower.

<span style="color:red;">Poorer for fishing</span> is indicated by increasingly red colors, showing where the likelihood of target catch is lower and the likelihood of bycatch is higher.

<details class="ecocast-faq">
<summary><strong>How is the EcoCast Map product made?</strong></summary>

Each day the EcoCast tool generates predictions of the spatial distributions of important migratory species, including those targeted for catch by fishers (swordfish) and those that may be unintentionally captured during commercial fishing activities (bycatch). Each distribution is then weighted, based on prevailing management strategies, to produce the Ecocast Map product.

<details class="ecocast-faq">
<summary><strong>How are the species weightings determined?</strong></summary>

Species weightings, which range from -1.0 to 1.0, are set to reflect management priorities and recent catch and bycatch events. A species is assigned a more negative weighting to avoid catch and a more positive weighting when catch is desired. For example, the default weightings (see map legend) are set to 0.9 for swordfish and -0.9 for leatherback turtles, creating a map that locates fishing areas where the chance of swordfish catch is optimal and the bycatch of leatherbacks, a protected and endangered species, is minimal. If there were elevated sea lion bycatch events, the weighting for that species (set to -0.05 by default) could be made more negative in order to locate fishing areas where the chance of their bycatch is less. You can use the [Explorer Tool](#ecocast_explore.qmd) to adjust species weightings based on your management scenarios and generate custom versions of the map.

<summary><strong>What environmental data are used?</strong></summary>

The EcoCast Map product uses the following satellite data:

- Sea surface chlorophyll concentration from [MODIS Aqua](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/chlor_a.php)
- Sea surface temperature
- Sea surface winds
- Sea surface height
- Eddy kinetic energy
