    "text": "EcoCast is a fisheries sustainability tool that helps fishers and managers evaluate how to allocate fishing effort to maintain target fish catch while minimizing bycatch of protected or threatened species.\nThe mission of our project is to bring best-available science and analyses to support the ecological sustainability and economic viability for U.S. fisheries. With decades of experience in fisheries bycatch, fisheries mapping, oceanographic and species distribution analyses, our research team is working to support the development of innovative management approaches that meet ecological and economic management objectives and mandates.\n\n\n\n\nEcoCast is a consortium of scientists, managers, and members of the fishing industry, including:\n\nSan Diego State University\n\nUC Santa Cruz\n\nUniversity of Maryland\n\nOld Dominion University\n\nStanford University\n\nNOAA Environmental Resource Division\n\nThey work directly with resource managers, fishing industry, and other stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\nFunding has been provided by:\n\nNASA EcoForecasting & Applied Science Program (NNH12ZDA001N-ECOF)\n\nCalifornia SeaGrant\n\nNOAA Bycatch Reduction Engineering Program\n\nNOAA West Coast Regional Office\n\nNOAA Integrated Ecosystem Assessment Program\n\nStanford Center for Ocean Solutions"

    "text": "Dynamic Ocean Management\nDynamic ocean management is a new management approach that uses real-time and near real-time data to support management responses that can change in space and time, at scales relevant for animal movement and human use. Dynamic ocean management can use diverse analytical approaches (simple to complex), supports climate-resilient fisheries, and is already implemented in many oceans around the world.\n\nHow does it differ from traditional ocean management?\nTraditional Ocean Management\n\nBoundaries are fixed in space and time.\nStatic schemes must be large enough to capture broad-scale ocean processes.\nCan have high opportunity costs for fishers.\nRendered ineffective during anomalous events (e.g. species seasonal migrations or shifts of fishing fleets).\n\nDynamic Ocean Management\n\nBoundaries and recommendations can change in near real time.\nAlign management actions with the variability of ecosystems.\nIncorporates diverse data sources:\n\nSatellite data\nOcean monitoring arrays\nBio-geochemical models\nCrowd-sourced reports from ocean users\n\nProvides managers with recommendations that reflect current marine conditions.\n\n\n\nWhy it matters\nDynamic ocean management sits at the interface of science and management. It captures the best-available science and directs it to meet the needs of resource managers and the fishing industry.\nWhat’s exciting about this research:\n\nPuts science and data analytics to work in real time, and\nFundamentally changes how oceans are managed."

If there were elevated sea lion bycatch events, the weighting for that species (set to -0.05 by default) could be made more negative in order to locate fishing areas where the chance of their bycatch is less.
